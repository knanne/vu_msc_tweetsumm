##Description
Microblogging has become increasingly popular recently on social sites for news reporting. In many cases, content on microblogging sites are produced online parallel to events unfolding offline. This research considers the scenario of gathering data surrounding a public event on Twitter, and automatically generating a summary to provide valuable news updates about that event.

The final dashboard visualizes 12 events, 6 from each of the 2 domains of Sporting events and Technology Conferences. Each event is summarized using three methods: 1. An "Engagements" approach considered as the state of the art that is currently implemented on Twitter, 2. An unsupervised event detection method with phrase reinforcement summarization algorithm called "PR SubEvents", and 3. A combined approach using event detection with the aid of a machine learning classifier called "PR+ SubEvents"
