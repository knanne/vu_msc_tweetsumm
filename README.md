##Description
Microblogging has become increasingly popular recently on social sites for news reporting. In many cases, content on microblogging sites are produced online parallel to events unfolding offline. This research considers the scenario of gathering data surrounding a public event on Twitter, and automatically generating a summary to provide valuable news updates about that event.

The final dashboard visualizes 12 events, 6 from each of the 2 domains of Sporting events and Technology Conferences. Each event is summarized for comparative evaluation using four methods: 

1. An "Engagements" approach considered as the state of the art that is currently implemented on Twitter when making a query 
2. An event detection method with phrase reinforcement summarization called "PR SubEvents"
3. An event detection method considering social engagements with phrase reinforcement summarization called "PR E SubEvents"
4. An event detection method considering social engagements, with corpus filtering using a supervised classifier, and then summarized using phrase reinforcement called "PR+ E SubEvents"
